                at Konark about 35 kilometres (22
                mi) northeast from Puri city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India.[1][2] The temple is
                attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE. <br>
                Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot
                (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m)
                high,[1][5] much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at
                one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived
                are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes.
                Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga
                architecture. <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konark_Sun_Temple" id="h">wikepedea</a>

                    and pink sandstone, it is on the
                    edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.
                    The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh,
                    the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so inspired by the unique
                    structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. <br>

            <b style="font-size: large;"> The Dwarkadhish temple </b>, also known as the Jagat Mandir and occasionally
            spelled Dwarakadheesh, is a Hindu temple
            dedicated to Krishna, who is worshiped here by the name Dwarkadhish, or 'King of Dwarka'. The temple is
            located
            at Dwarka city of Gujarat, India, which is one of the destinations of Char Dham, a Hindu pilgrimage circuit.
            The
            main shrine of the five-storied building, supported by 72 pillars, is known as Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir.
            Archaeological findings suggest the original temple was built in 200 BCE at the earliest.[1][2][3] The
            temple
            was rebuilt and enlarged in the 15th–16th century.[4][5] <br>

            According to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by Krishna's grandson,
            Vajranabha,
            over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place). The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in
            1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th–16th century,[citation needed] in the Māru-Gurjara style.

                Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)
                complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
                crenellated wall <br>

                in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of
                Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan
                commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra
                to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also
                constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines
                Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
